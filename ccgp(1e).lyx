Earlier larger volume books on graphs were written by us but then we thought
 that probably the student might lose interst in them.
 So we thought of writing a very concise and to the point book for Physics
 Graphs.
 And the outcome of this advent is the present book.

\begin_layout Standard
A graph is an accurate pictorial representation of data.
 The accuracy of data in physics requires that graphs be made on good quality
 graph paper.
 Nearly all graphs in physics are smooth line graphs; broken line (connect
 the dots) graphs and bar graphs are seldom appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style and format of a graph will depend upon its intended purpose.
 Three types are common in physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 PICTORIAL GRAPHS.
 These are the kind found in mathematics and physics textbooks.
 Their purpose is to simply and clearly illustrate a mathematical relation.
 No attempt is made to show data points or errors on such a graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 DISPLAY GRAPHS.
 These present the data from an experiment.
 They are found in laboratory reports, research journals, and sometimes
 in textbooks.
 They show the data points as well as a smooth line representing the mathematica
l relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 COMPUTATIONAL GRAPHS.
 These are drawn for the purpose of extracting a numerical result from the
 data.
 An example is the calculation of the slope of a straight line graph, or
 its intercepts.

Certain informational and stylistic features are required in all graphs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The graph must have a descriptive title or caption, clearly stating what
 the graph illustrates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Data points are plotted as small dots with a sharp pencil, or as pinpricks.
 Some method should be used to emphasize the location of the points, for
 example, a neat circle drawn around each point.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A French curve is a template usually made from metal, wood or plastic composed
 of many different curves.
 It is used in manual drafting to draw smooth curves of varying radii.
 The shapes are segments of the Euler spiral or clothoid curve.
 The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a pencil, knife or other
 implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems use vector-based graphics to
 achieve a precise radius, so no template is required.
 Digital computers can also be used to generate a set of coordinates that
 accurately describe an arbitrary curve, and the points can be connected
 with line segments to approximate the curve with a high degree of accuracy.
 Some computer-graphics systems make use of Bézier curves, which allow a
 curve to be bent in real time on a display screen to follow a set of coordinate
s, much in the way a French curve would be placed on a set of three or four
 points on paper.

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Choose scales that are convenient to plot and easy to read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Choose scales such that the graph occupies most of the page.
 The two scales need not have the same size units.
 Also, the scales need not begin at zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Indicate the name, letter symbol and units of each variable plotted on
 each axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 All text (title, labels, etc.) should be printed.

\begin_layout Standard
PHYSICAL SLOPE AND GEOMETRIC SLOPE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slope.
 When textbooks refer to the "slope" of a plotted graph line we mean the
 "physical slope"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
physical slope = 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{\text{Δ}y}{\text{Δ}x}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Δy and Δx are expressed in the physical units of the x and y axes.
 This slope has physical significance in describing the physical data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Geometric slope.
 A line which makes a 45° angle with an axis will not necessarily have a
 physical slope of size 1.
 Some authors introduce the term "geometric slope" to describe the tilt
 of the line on the page.
 This is a ratio of lengths of the legs of the triangle, without reference
 to the units plotted on the axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is seldom (probably never) any need to calculate the geometric slope
 of a line on a graph.
 The idea is only useful when describing the appearance of the graph on
 the page.
 One rule of graph construction states that the graph should occupy most
 of the page.
 For square graph paper this suggests a geometric slope of 45°.
 See Fig for examples of good and bad choices of geometric slope.

Both axes are labeled with the full name of the quantity (not merely its
 symbol), and its units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted points and curve should occupy most (more than half) of the
 area of the graph paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes a small sketch of the experimental situation may be included,
 located where it will not confuse the interpretation of the graph.
 In the same manner an equation, or short explanatory comment, may be included.

Graphical Representation of Uncertainties

Graphical Representation of Uncertainties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display graphs and computational graphs should clearly show the size of
 the experimental uncertainties (errors) in each plotted point.
 There are several conventional ways to do this, the commonest being the
 use of error bars illustrated below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ImagesReduced/Graphs/Introduction/G03.jpg
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure : Various styles of error bars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted point is represented as a dot, and the range of uncertainty
 is shown by the extent of the bars on either side.
 The types shown in (a) are suitable where the error is entirely in one
 variable, or where the errors in both variables have been lumped together.
 The types shown in (b) are preferred where it is necessary to show the
 error in each variable explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the uncertainties have a symmetric distribution about the mean, the
 error bars extend equally on either side of the points.
 If the data distributions are not symmetric, the plotted points will not
 be centrally located in the range of uncertainty and the error bars might
 look like those in Figure.
 part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars may not be necessary when the data points are so numerous that
 their scatter is clearly shows the uncertainty.
 In these cases error bars would clutter the graph making it difficult to
 interpret.
 Another situation where error bars are inappropriate is when the scale
 of the graph is such that the bars would be very small.
 In this case, it may be possible to indicate the uncertainty by the size
 of the circle or rectangle surrounding each point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Curve Fitting
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Curve Fitting
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve drawn through plotted data need not pass exactly through every
 data point.
 But usually the curve should pass within the uncertainty range of each
 point, that is, within the error bars, if the bars represent limits of
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One principle of curve fitting is also a fundamental rule of science itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the simplest relation consistent with the data.
 We are not justified in assuming a more complex relation than can be demonstrat
ed by the data.
 If a curve were drawn with detail smaller than the data uncertainty, that
 detail would be only a guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rule of simplicity may also be expressed mathematically.
 The mathematical relations encountered in physics may often be represented
 by power series such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $y=A+Bx+Cx^{2}+Dx^{3}+Ex^{4}+...$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where A, B, C, ...
 are constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For very "wiggly" curves, many terms of this equation, including high powers
 of x, might be required to express the equation of the relation.
 The simplest relations are those which contain the smallest powers of x.
 The simplest relations of all are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = a or y = a + bx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which describe straight lines.
 Many relations in physics are, fortunately, of this form.
 Others only include the 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 term, describing a parabolic curve.
 Note that double valued curves, sometimes encountered in physics, cannot
 be represented by Equation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sizable amounts of data are taken, standard mathematical methods are
 available which generate the equation of the simplest curve which statistically
 "best fits" the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student may wonder how one can be certain that the curve fitted to the
 data is the "correct" curve.
 The answer is that relations are never known with certainty.
 The uncertainty of available data always limits the certainty of the results.
 Someday someone may obtain more accurate data and be able to show that
 the old relations are slightly incorrect, and provide us with better ones.
 As data improves, so does our understanding of relations—this is the way
 of scientific progress.
 But we never should claim to know a relation better than the data allows.

Uncertainty in a Slope

\begin_layout Standard
One use of a computational graph is to determine the slope of a straight
 line.
 This is illustrated in Figure.
 Eight data points are shown with error bars on each.
 If these bars represent maximum error, any line drawn to represent this
 data should pass within all bars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the error bars represent error estimates smaller than the maximum (average
 deviation, standard deviation, etc.), then the fitted curve need not pass
 within all of the error bars, just most of them.

The dotted lines A and C fall within the error bars, and represent the maximum

\begin_layout Standard
where the variables are x and y, and m and b are constants.
 When y is plotted against x on ordinary Cartesian (linear) graph paper,
 the points fall on a straight line with slope m and a y-intercept b, as
 shown in Fig.
 1.5.
\end_layout

The slope of an experimental relation is often physically significant.
 It is obtained by choosing two well-separated points on the line (x

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far this discussion has been strictly mathematical.
 Now let's consider a fairly realistic physical example.
 Figure.
 shows the curve from measurements of the velocity of a moving body as a
 function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we use letters v for velocity and t for time, we'd expect this curve
 to be described by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the constant a (acceleration) is the slope of the line, while v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 plays the role of b in Equation.
 These two constants are physically significant, and we wish to find their
 values from the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose two points on the line at t = 4.25 and 8.75, with corresponding
 values of velocity: 42 cm/s and 98 cm/s.
 Mark these points on Figure.
 , to confirm these values.
 The slope of the line is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $a=\dfrac{(98cm/s-42cm/s)}{8.75s-4.25s}=\dfrac{56}{4.5}\;cm/s^{2}=56/4.5\;cm/s^{2}=12.44cm/s^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When calculating this ratio do not use ruler-measured lengths.
 The lengths are expressed in the units marked on the graph axes.
 The calculated slope is therefore independent of the particular choice
 of units, of the way you choose to label the graph scale divisions, and
 is also independent of the size of the graph paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
INTERCEPTS: The values of the intercepts are often physically significant.
 They can be simply read from the graph—if the 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 axes happen to be within the graph's boundaries.
 In the equation y = mx + b, the y intercept is b.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The v intercept of Figure.
 is the value of v when t = 0.
 It has the same units and dimensions as y.
 If, as in this case, the v intercept does not lie within the area of the
 graph, it may be calculated using the slope and one value taken from a
 point on the fitted line.
 Take the point v = 98 cm/s when t = 8.75 sec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v

 , shows that this looks reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STRAIGHTENING A CURVE.
 When it is possible to convert an experimental relation to a straight line
 graph it is usually useful to do so.
 Look for such opportunities.
 For example, when studying gases at constant temperature we find that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PV = C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where P is pressure, V is the gas volume and C is constant.
 The graph of P vs.
 V is a branch of an hyperbola.
 But if we graph P vs.
 1/V, or V vs.
 1/P, the data would fall on a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason for doing this is that it is easier to fit the experimental data
 with a ruler-drawn straight line, than to draw the best hyperbola on a
 PV graph.
 Another advantage is that the P vs.
 1/V graph has a slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $C=\dfrac{\triangle P}{\triangle\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore the constant C is easily determined from the straight line.
 This constant was not evident, nor was it easy to determine from the PV
 graph!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inexpensive electronic calculators make it so easy to manipulate data that
 there is no good excuse to pass up an opportunity to "linearize" experimental
 graphs.

Common Graph Forms in Physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working with graphs – interpreting, creating, and employing – is an essential
 skill in the sciences, and especially in physics where relationships need
 to be derived.
 As an introductory physics student you should be familiar with the typical
 forms of graphs that appear in physics.
 Below are a number of typical physical relationships exhibited graphically
 using standard X-Y coordinates (e.g., no logarithmic, power, trigonometric,
 or inverse plots, etc.).
 Study the forms of the graphs carefully, and be prepared to use the program
 Graphical Analysis to formulate relationships between variables by using
 appropriate curve-fitting strategies.
 Note that all non-linear forms of graphs can be made to appear linear by
 “linearizing” the data.
 Linearization consists of such things as plotting X versus Y
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 or X versus 1/Y or Y versus log (X), etc.
 Note: While a 5th order polynomial might give you a better fit to the data,
 it might not represent the simplest model.

This might be a graph of the pressure and temperature for a changing volume

 How would you find this relationship short of using a computer package?
 The answer is to simplify the plot by manipulating the data.
 Plot the Y variable versus the inverse of the X variable.
 The graph becomes a straight line.
 The resulting formula will be Y = A/X or XY = A.
 This is typical of Boyle’s law:

 The better fit is the one with the smaller RMSE.

d) As the Graph A has a constant slope, so the acceleration of body A is
 zero.
 Whereas Graph B is constantly turning, so the slope can be assumed to be
 non-zero throughout.
 According to some revelations, however it is noted that the figure is not
 clear enough to show whether Graph B is straight after

 For this graph the impulse (the area under the graph) is 2000 kg ms

Change in Momentum or the "Impulse" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The change in the momentum of a system (or the impulse delivered by the
 net force) is given mathematically by the Momentum Principle, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pa.msu.edu"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this form, the change in momentum is calculated over a “discrete” time
 step.
 That is, the calculation is done over a known or determined time interval.
 If the force is non-constant (i.e., depends on location or velocity), this
 calculation is not exact.
 In fact, in this case, the net force is the average net force over the
 time interval.
 So that a better definition is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net,avg}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition works well for case where you might use iterative procedures
 to determine the change in momentum over small time intervals.
 If on the other hand, you can analytically integrate the force (e.g., it
 is or can be put into a form which is time dependent), then you can use
 the derivative form of the Momentum Principle,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Δ\overrightarrow{p}=\intop_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}\overset{\rightarrow}{F}_{net}dt$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In any event, either (or both) can be useful to think about graphs of force
 vs time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Force vs Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations, it is easier to empirically measure force versus time
 graphs because the situations lend themselves more easily to these empirical
 measurements rather than what might be more complex physical theories.
 This is true in different engineering contexts (e.g., impact design and the
 flow of fluids).
 In these cases, you are interested in determining the change in momentum
 (and thus the velocity) of the system in question1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a force vs time graph where the “area under the curve” has been
 highlighted.
 In this example, we are only looking at the component of the net force
 in the xx-direction.
 Such graphs can be produced for each component of the net force, but let's
 say that for this system, there was a non-zero component of the net force
 only in the x-direction.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the above figure, the momentum change over the complete time interval
 can be determined in a straightforward way due to the simple geometric
 shapes produced.
 Area above the zero line are positive momentum changes, and area below
 are negative.
 By adding up the “area under the curve” in this way, we obtain a momentum
 change of 7 Ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 In this case, the graph has a smooth form, which doesn't appear to be analytic.
 The “area under the curve” for this graph could be analyzed computationally,
 by taking small steps (i.e., Riemann Sum), and the change in momentum could
 be determined.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer The change in momentum (area under the force time graph) can't be
 changed at the time of the accident (mass is fixed and it is too late for
 the driver to slow down!) By increasing the time of collision the peak
 force is less and hopefully lets the occupants come to less harm as a result.

Static Friction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Static frictional forces from the interlocking of the irregularities of
 two surfaces will increase to prevent any relative motion up until some
 limit where motion occurs.
 It is that threshold of motion which is characterized by the coefficient
 of static friction.
 The coefficient of static friction is typically larger than the coefficient
 of kinetic friction.

\begin_layout Standard
In making a distinction between static and kinetic coefficients of friction,
 we are dealing with an aspect of "real world" common experience with a
 phenomenon which cannot be simply characterized.
 The difference between static and kinetic coefficients obtained in simple
 experiments like wooden blocks sliding on wooden inclines roughly follows
 the model depicted in the friction plot from which the illustration above
 is taken.
 This difference may arise from irregularities, surface contaminants, etc.
 which defy precise description.
 When such experiments are carried out with smooth metal blocks which are
 carefully cleaned, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients
 tends to disappear.
 When coefficients of friction are quoted for specific surface combinations
 are quoted, it is the kinetic coefficient which is generally quoted since
 it is the more reliable number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Kinetic Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When two surfaces are moving with respect to one another, the frictional
 resistance is almost constant over a wide range of low speeds, and in the
 standard model of friction the frictional force is described by the relationshi
p below.
 The coefficient is typically less than the coefficient of static friction,
 reflecting the common experience that it is easier to keep something in
 motion across a horizontal surface than to start it in motion from rest.

Having taken a large number of students through this experiment, I can report
 that the coefficient of static friction obtained is almost always greater
 than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
 Typical results for the woods I have used are 0.4 for the static coefficient
 and 0.3 for the kinetic coefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When carefully standardized surfaces are used to measure the friction coefficien
ts, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients tends to disappear,
 indicating that the difference may have to do with irregular surfaces,
 impurities, or other factors which can be frustratingly non-reproducible.
 To quote a view counter to the above model of friction: "Many people believe
 that the friction to be overcome to get something started (static friction)
 exceeds the force required to keep it sliding (sliding friction), but with
 dry metals it is very hard to show any difference.
 The opinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or
 lubricant are present, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs
 or other flexible supports so that they appear to bind." R.

Rolling Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rolling wheel requires a certain amount of friction so that the point
 of contact of the wheel with the surface will not slip.
 The amount of traction which can be obtained for an auto tire is determined
 by the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road.
 If the wheel is locked and sliding, the force of friction is determined
 by the coefficient of kinetic friction and is usually significantly less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that a wheel is rolling without slipping, the surface friction
 does no work against the motion of the wheel and no energy is lost at that
 point.
 However, there is some loss of energy and some deceleration from friction
 for any real wheel, and this is sometimes referred to as rolling friction.
 It is partly friction at the axle and can be partly due to flexing of the
 wheel which will dissipate some energy.
 Figures of 0.02 to 0.06 have been reported as effective coefficients of rolling
 friction for automobile tires, compared to about 0.8 for the maximum static
 friction coefficient between the tire and the road.

 : (Theory : So far we've implied some things about what is constant and
 what can change in the impulse formula F Δt = m Δv.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at situations where we expect the mass of the object will stay constant.
 • The velocity will change, and that's why we put a delta in front of it.
 • Time is changing (sort of) as we measure it over a period of time.
 • Force must be a constant.
 We assume that the force being exerted on the object was always the same,
 causing a constant acceleration.
 If we are looking at a simple impulse question (where the force is constant),
 we can figure out exactly what we can interpret from a graph.
 • Later this may help us to figure out a more complicated question, like
 if the force changes.
 The following graph is an example of one of those simple situations where
 the force remains constant during the entire time.
 • If we look at what the slope might represent, we get...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
slope = rise / run 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
slope = F / 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$

\begin_layout Standard
Since nothing in the impulse formula can be rearranged to give us force
 over time, the slope doesn't mean anything to us in this situation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we really wanted to, we could have simply use Δp = FΔt to figure out
 the impulse.
 We could do this in this situation because the force is constant.
 • If we need to do a question where the force is not constant, we can still
 use the area under the line to get the impulse, even though the formula
 Δp = FΔt can not be used.

Example : I am in a car that is accelerating from rest at a red light.
 I want to calculate the impulse that is acting on the car during the first

 N over this time, determine the impulse.
 If the mass of the car is 1500 kg, also determine the final velocity of
 the car.

EXPLORATION – An impulsive bike ride Suki is riding her bicycle, in a straight
 line, along a flat road.
 Suki and her bike have a combined mass of 50 kg.
 At t = 0, Suki is traveling at 8.0 m/s.
 Suki coasts for 10 seconds, but when she realizes she is slowing down,
 she pedals for the next 20 seconds.
 Suki pedals so that the static friction force exerted on the bike by the
 road increases linearly with time from 0 to 40 N, in the direction Suki
 is traveling, over that 20-second period.
 Assume there is constant 10 N resistive force, from air resistance and
 other factors, acting on her and the bicycle the entire time.
 Step 1 - Sketch a diagram of the situation.
 The diagram is shown in Figure 6.2, along with the free-body diagram that
 applies for the first 10 s and the free-body diagram that applies for the
 20second period while Suki is pedaling.

 gradually increases because of the way Suki pedals.

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 - Sketch a graph of the net force acting on Suki and her bicycle
 as a function of time.
 Take the positive direction to be the direction Suki is traveling.
 In the vertical direction, the normal force exactly balances the force
 of gravity, so we can focus on the horizontal forces.
 For the first 10 seconds, we have only the 10 N resistive force, which
 acts to oppose the motion and is thus in the negative direction.
 For the next 20 seconds, we have to account for the friction force that
 acts in the direction of motion and the resistive force.
 We can account for their combined effect by drawing a straight line that
 goes from –10 N at t = 10 s, to +30 N (40 N – 10N) at t = 30 s.
 The result is shown in Figure 6.3.

Figure 6.3: A graph of the net force acting on Suki and her bicycle as a
 function of time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 3 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 10 s? Let’s apply Equation 6.3, which
 we can write as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{\rightarrow}{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=\text{∆}(m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})=m\text{∆}\overrightarrow{v}=m(\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}-\overrightarrow{v_{i}})$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the velocity at t = 10 s gives: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}=\overrightarrow{v_{i}}+\dfrac{\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t}{m}=+8.0m/s+\dfrac{(-10N)(10s)}{50kg}=+8.0m/s-2.0m/s=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, Suki’s speed at t = 10 s is 6.0 m/s.
 We can also obtain this result from the forceversus-time graph, by recognizing
 that the impulse, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t$
\end_inset

 , represents the area under this graph over some time interval ∆t .
 Let’s find the area under the graph, over the first 10 seconds, shown highlight
ed in green in Figure 6.4.
 The area is negative, because the net force is negative over that time
 interval.
 The area under the graph is the impulse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=-10N\times10s=-100Ns=-100kg\;m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6.4: The green rectangle represents the area under the graph for the
 first 10 s.
 The area is negative, because the force is negative.
 From Equation 6.3, we know the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.

Suki’s initial momentum is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $m\overrightarrow{v_{i}}=50kg\times8.0m/s=+400kg\;m/s$
\end_inset

 .
 Her momentum at t = 10 s is therefore + 400kg m/s - 100kg m/s = + 300kg
 m/s .
 Dividing this by the mass to find the velocity at t = 10 s confirms what
 we found above: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v}_{10s}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{10s}}}{m}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{i}}+\triangle\overrightarrow{p}}{m}=\dfrac{+400kgm/s-100kgm/s}{50kg}=\dfrac{+300kgm/s}{50kg}=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 4 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 30 s? Let’s use the area under the
 force-versus-time graph, between t = 10 s and t = 30 s, to find Suki’s
 change in momentum over that 20-second period.
 This area is highlighted in Figure 6.5, split into a negative area for the
 time between t = 10 s and t = 15 s, and a positive area between t = 15
 s and t = 30 s.
 These regions are triangles, so we can use the equation for the area of
 a triangle, 0.5 × base × height .
 The area under the curve, between 10 s and 15 s, is 0.5 × (5.0s) ×( - 10
 N) = - 25kg m/s .
 The area between 15 s and 30 s is 0.5 × (15s) × (30 N) = + 225kg m/s .
 The total area (total change in momentum) is +200 kg m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that another approach is to multiply the average net force acting on
 Suki and the bicycle (+10 N) over this interval, by the time interval (20
 s), for a +200 kg m/s change in momentum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6.5: The shaded regions correspond to the area under the curve for
 the time interval from t = 10 s to t = 30 s.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In step 3, we determined that Suki’s momentum at t = 10 s is +300 kg m/s.
 With the additional 200 kg m/s, the net momentum at t = 10 s is +500 kg
 m/s.
 Dividing by the 50 kg mass gives a velocity at t = 30 s of +10 m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key idea for the graphical interpretation of impulse: The area under the
 net force versus time graph for a particular time interval is equal to
 the change in momentum during that time interval.

Position vs time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph of position verse time is a sine wave with a possible phase shift.
 The phase shift is how much the ahead or behind the position is on the
 sine wave.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider this graph, if the "clock" is started at 0.05 (where the mass is
 at it's maximum stretch) seconds then there would be a phase shift of 90
 degrees (or we could replace the sine function for a cosine).
 If the "clock" is started at 0.1 seconds (where mass moves down instead
 of up; left instead of right) then the phase shift would be 180 degrees
 (a negative sine function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Velocity vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the position verses time graph, at any point were the mass has
 reached the amplitude (maximum distance from from the equilibrium point)
 the speed of the mass at these point is zero.
 When the position is at zero then the speed is at a maximum (if you don't
 believe it, consider conservation of energy).
 This "shifts" the position graph by 90 degrees "creating" a cosine graph
 for velocity.
 The other way of thinking about is velocity is the change in position with
 respect to time, the change in a sine wave with respect to time is a cosine
 graph.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Acceleration vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acceleration verse time graph is the easiest of the graphs to make.
 The simple harmonic motion is based on a relationship between position
 and acceleration; x = - Ka.
 So the graph of position and acceleration should look alike, except for
 the negative sign.
 In fact position and acceleration are the same shape just mirror copies
 of each other.

Peak Height
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the shapes of each graph is simular, that each
 graph has the same frequency, period and wavelength, but they don't have
 the same amplitude, for common simple harmonic motion, the height the peak
 of the function (not to confused with the amplitude, amplitude refers to
 the height of the position graph alone, i'm talking about the height of
 the position, velocity and acceleration graphs) tend to get smaller and
 smaller starting with the position graph being the tallest and the acceleration
 being the shortest.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Graphing position, velocity, and acceleration with respect to each other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphing position to the other functions can be complicated and when tested
 on it, most student are unable to give the right answer.
 First consider this, for simple harmonic motion position and acceleration
 are proportional.
 x = -k a this is a linear relationship so the graph is a line, the slope
 is negative so the line is heading down.

Position and acceleration verses velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position and acceleration verse velocity graph look entirely different.
 First off the straight line test fails when plotting position vs velocity
 or acceleration verse velocity.
 Take the point were x and a are zero, there are two possible answers for
 the point (the speed maybe at maximum) the object could be moving down
 or up at the point.
 That means the velocity can be a positive maximum or a negative maximum,
 two separate values.
 Looking a the points were the velocity is equal to zero, there are two
 possible answers, either at the top or at the bottom.
 If you continue to plot data points graph that is developed is a ellisipe

Concept : Free body diagram of liquid can be drawn in similar manner as
 we draw the free body diagram of a solid.
 The only difference is, what we call the normal reaction between solid-solid
 boundary, we here call it pressure X area in case of liquids.
 Both are prependicular to the surface.

In Figure let the charge on a capacitor of capacitance C at any instant
 be q, and let V be the potential difference across it at that instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current (I) in the discharge at that instant is therefore: I = - dq/dt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But V = IR and q = CV so dq/dt = d(CV)/dt = C dV/dt Therefore we have V

You should realise that the term RC governs the rate at which the charge

When t = RC, V = Vo/e = 0.37 Vo and the product RC is known as the time constant
