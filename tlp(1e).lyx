\begin_layout Chapter*
Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book is based on existing knowledge on Physics already available with
 various Physics Instituitions and now being presented in Author's own words.
 It is really fortunate that lots of good reading material is already available
 in the market so that a physics learner can quench his or her appitite.
 However , we would like to go a step further and present the India's native
 way of learning physics presented by one of World's toppers in his academics
 and also an enticing journalist in his work field, the Author Mr.
 Rajat Kalia .
 He further wants his son Manas Kalia to take this book forward during his
 lifetime and be a part of his father's contributions to the world education
 system.
 Rajat wants his son Manas Kalia to be a doctor from AIIMS , though at the
 time of this writing , Manas is only 7 years old.
 So this much ahead in future is being planned all due to God's grace .
 So this book would have nearly two generations of our family mostly devoted
 to it and both having top of the world class education themselves, Rajat
 an IITian and Manas if he is able to join AIIMS then he too would be the
 righteous and just candidate for writing this book further.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rajat spent part of his career at very small coaching institutes and software
 companies with very small infrastructure compared to what IITians usually
 work in ,in Chandigarh as during the very initial phase of his career ,
 while working in Gameloft at their Hydrabad development centre he met with
 a very serious accident.
 Fortune 500 MNC's and bon bon America IITian dream completely shattered.
 Though althrough a topper , he managed to pull himself back out of the
 mess but then again the failed marriage was part of his before 30 years
 life.
 Still the son Manas Kalia was very intelligent since very early childhood
 and definitely deserved an already good work from his father which he could
 take further during his lifetime.
 Further Rajat started suffering from a mental disease due to the Military
 beating he got in Hyderabad accident , the disease Reverse Scizophrenia.
 This disease coupled wih meditation he learned from Guru Sham Giri ( real
 name Surender Giri ) gave him a perfect vision for seeing the physics happeinin
gs with his own eyes.
 Later Rajat himself figured out that the American dream wasn't exactly
 all he was looking for and India too had everything needfull .
 Being a pampared child since childhood did the work .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rajat has written some AOE2:TC 1.0 and 1.0e maps with one map Attila@Gmetro_v3
 getting very popular.
 His as a player career was totally dwindling and he could not be in world's
 250 ranks till one day one 4v4 with Chris having Nilgiri's BSF and Aravali's
 Arjun Gaur in his team and Rajat's team having Cuitlauac and Kumaon's cultural
 secretary Harry ( with handle creator ) , the game Rajat's team won and
 he had a 15 minutes castle and an Elephant Flush.
 He however mistook Chris for Voodoo as he wasn't playing in his usual form
 or probably 1.0 Fast speed was bit new settings for him or maybe India's
 whether too bad for him .
 He was probably staying in some IIT hostel too it is believed and probably
 came for intern.
 People said he was real L_Clan_Chris later.
 After that Rajat's teams won most matches they played and remained in amongst
 Game's top players in India.
 Later other smaller groups too established including the BSK and Indus
 etc but were wiped out with time as the game's new mod didn't have much
 people playing it .
 One guy Sasi Sekhar died too probably owing to his due to the game hallucinatio
ns.
 He was from BITS Pilani and doing in Indus clan during the initial phase
 of it's formation and died in America.
 He was nearly Rajat's age .
 Moreover Rajat's father claims that Rajat's disease has a lot to do with
 the game too and it's the game which is the real cause of the mental disease.
 However , Rajat later played World at Arms and Castle Siege (AOE) and was
 a fierce player and managed his groups well.
 Rajat also played in 7 Hardest game and won using Koreans Civilization
 .
 Rajat's friend and game critic Rahul Aggarwal claims that Hardest didn't
 play well in that game, while Rajat says that 3 of the scouts of the computers
 were killed in the intiial 7 or 8 minutes and this leads to the the AI
 performing really bad in 1.0 settings.
 Moreover Rajat was playing aggressive and one of the hardests resigned
 in 20 minutes due to tower attack, and only one or two of them could reach
 imperial.
 The part which usual fans like the most is that Rajat had nearly full populatio
n of Elite War Wagons ( 200 then ) by the end of the game.
 The movie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

3 Idiots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shows the name of IIT as Imperial college of Engineering as most of the
 people in IIT's during those times played Age of Empires ( espeically the
 people whom Aamir represents , the common engineers ) and play in Castle
 age and don't like Imperial age wars.
 AIIMS is a similar way in Medical and has even lesser seats than IIT and
 Manas would also be my kind i think.
 The name change of IIT to Imperial college of Engineering simply let the
 movie connect to other smaller good colleges where AOE was the face of
 a magna , and good for the movie's earnings and also a kind of joke on
 IITians , that they do this game and all stuff once they reach IIT and
 spoil their career.
 Not the same with the story and the presentation of the movie and also
 the theme song 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Saari umra ham
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which only represents IIT and nothing else.
 Other games Rajat had a faction HN_Clan like in World at Arms and Castle
 Siege and they did good too.
 Earlier in olden times wikipeidia pages of HN Clan and India Cup were created
 and they too added to the publicity.
 The Indian Gamers Organization owned by Rajat and having website with the
 same name had massive response .
 Article series were written on AOE India orkut page and some initial 15
 or 16 articles are still there on the web.
 Rajat wrote a total of around 250 articles in the Newbie FAQ thread.
 Abis Ottoman a pune guy with this handle wrote well in Rajat's favour some
 interesting prose and was our good friend till he all of a sudden vanished
 and Rajat too met with accident and that's how our team ended .
 Beyonder ( Vishesh Dahinwal ) was a good guide.
 Niraj Patel (BSF) too played and guided well till one day he switched sides
 in favour of Nilgiri people who were playing puny hostel politics in an
 Inter India competition and then Akshay Kumar from Oracle , he too later
 created an Anti group on Orkut.
 Rajat won Tryst 2005/2006 tourneys and was amongst the winners in War of
 Million , these being the India's top AOE tourneys.
 He had a massive fan following and critic and anti groups too in large
 number as the supporters.
 In Computer Games he was the only pheonomenon India ever had even to this
 date.
 Mostly becouse no single game could ever get as popular as AOE in India
 and Rajat was a popular software worker with his software tobu one of the
 everydoor name before he began his AOE career, the new advent of Internet
 post to 2000 Y2K fear and hype and he has contributed to a great extent
 in promoting India's games industry and it's not considered that bad a
 taboo as it was in those days though Rajat is all set to recieve his 5
 pending electric shocks for Reverse Scizophrenia treatment but has contributed
 in a great deal to pave way for future generations in safety while his
 own son probably would have some psychiatric problem probably due to excessive
 exposure to games and computers too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Software too Rajat has done extremely well .
 Rajat completed his software learning during the very beginning of his
 IIT phase and being one of the pioneers introducing Computers to other
 likers post to the 2001 entry in IIT.
 During that phase Games had not at all got introduced in IIT and Rajat
 and friends were all learning and exploring.
 Rajat got to admin a partially corrupted software Tobu which got out of
 control due to some accident with it's server and non of the creator's
 or caretakers had any clue on what had gone wrong .
 Rajat was the hot shot software guy and was approached for dead tobu's
 revival and it ran for nearly 2 years till 2004-05 and became the face
 of IIT to the outside visitors .
 A parallel Kumon e-governance site was also created by Rajat's juniors
 under his guidance during that period.
 Then one Startup guy got Rajat and Party for creating some mobile phone
 messenger back in 2004 , we see those concepts now in practicality now
 as in 2018 while those were budding concepts then and they were amongst
 the core introducers.
 Hacking too he did considerable work on but were appropriately punished
 by the IIT authorities.
 Then Rajat was creating one inventory control system for Indian Air Force
 , BRD 13 .
 He could not complete the project due to the ongoing hacking case on him
 during that period in IIT but atleast IAF got the concept and would have
 probably got it completed as IITians were specially hired during that period
 and Rajat's concept was really pathbreaking in those times(2006) and later
 now in 2018 we see even very small companies using inventory control using
 that concept.
 Gameloft job was a dream come true for Rajat , job in Game industry and
 that too in a top Game company.
 Rajat worked further too on many projects like the varnishlog filtering
 for Xataka and Graphs Engine of Intellectual Property Rights in GreyB and
 all have been known as good and pathbreaking concepts which can absorb
 future generations to work on them and even in the intervening 12-15 years
 large portions of software industry have worked on them and they were Rajat's
 concepts initially and it would look like a sort of wonder to you.
 Wherever Rajat has gone for working in software , he has introduced new
 concepts and it's strange that we have got most of the software population
 working on those concepts till much later ages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Mathematics and Physics he wrote nearly 20 books and one more 3 to 5
 edition book on social science and commerce .
 While the Maths and Physics books got good reviews , the commerce and social
 science books became one of the key scripts for the movie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

PK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is also the name of his wife pooja kalia and presents a scientific
 approach to the way religion is being presented in the world and presents
 how he himself saw religion while growing up .
 While he was very critisized sometimes for being similar looking to aamir
 khan and that aamir made the movie pk due to the questions the movie raised
 on current religious practices , however the common indian crowd which
 doesn't want to be scientific started putting their wrath on aamir khan
 like looking people who even happen to be common engineers and have in
 reality created the pk script and seen it their whole life and really absurd
 comments like

Introduction

\begin_layout Chapter
Physics in a nutshell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I won't start with the statement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Physics is everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It's an old statement.
 I would instead start with let's say , what's a blackhole or a quasar or
 a pulsar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you are in +1/+2 so mostly you know about gravitation , current , pressure
 etc.
 So, in a blackhole, let's see at the centre first, one possibility is that
 there's extreme pressure, temprature gravitation and current.
 Second possibility is that above the centre the forces balance out, like
 in case of sun, it's being said that even though above it's extremely hot
 with plasma and neuclear fusion reactions going on , in the inside it is
 not so and there are people out there trying to scientifically prove it.
 There are sci-fi movies like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Core
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which say that earths centre is also the same as sun and there is no hot
 core and it's a primitive civilization living inside the earth, however
 in case of earth, these claims have been widely rejected, maybe possible
 in case of somewhere else in the universe's earth, i mean some other earth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what is a blackhole.
 Is it something to be inquisitive of.
 Is it something to be afraid of?? Or is it the solution to all our problems.
 And why am i interested in blackhole and how can i help in learning about
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
{Gandhiji's 3 monkeys : Don't see bad, don't speak bad , don't chat bad.
 Now every mental patient can be classified in one of these three types,
 the ones who use their vision to see bad things etc.
 and in return lose both their eyes in old age as a punishment and then
 there are other two types of monkeys}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So , due to my disease which is a form of Paranoid Scizophrenia , i can
 look into matter (where i am guided to see it) .
 I can use it to peek into some girl's bathroom or else i can see and show
 a blackhole's structure.
 Don't worry I am not a dangerous person who can spy on you, I take medicine
 now.
 These things which i am showing here are what I saw before taking medicine
 and now i have faint memory of them.
 Gandhiji claimed that every person in the world is one of these three types
 of monkeys and has one of these special gifts which connects them to God
 and after 35 years of age everybody has old age protection from god's side.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what exactly the use of these blackholes , quasars and pulsar's etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They can create heavier elements than our normal 118 elements .
 But then why don't we find these elements created by blackholes anywhere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I will tell what I have seen , then later I'll tell the fantasy.
 Blackholes are the excretion points of the universe where they consume
 worn out planets and stars and exit them out of this universe by feeding
 them to the other end of the opening of other universes about to be created
 .
 Now a question arises, if this much mass was teleported out of the universe,
 where does the universe balance it's mass from.
 The answer is again what I can see , the universe boundries have a shell
 like covering made of faint white and black salt which creates life and
 matter.
 from there the material enters , from blackholes it exits.
 But then we know of the nutron burst which created the universe? Don't
 blackholes consume all mass and all planets and stars and grow big to become
 the neutron star? and then it bursts again to create the univese again
 .
 The answer is , yes this is one alternate mechanism.
 I told our universe's mechanism and you are telling the one connected to
 yours.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Million dollar question? What happens to US when these blackholes consume
 everything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there is a 2 Rupee answer (provided free of cost or covered in the price
 of this book).
 We have already moved to alternate universes and blackholes consume only
 completely dead planets and solar systems.
 So when the universe is completely dead , then the neutron star is formed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another irritation in brain.
 What is a universe according to hindu religion? It's the body of bhagwan
 in spirtual domain.
 Like we have a body, now we are on the outside , we can't take care or
 look inside , so we are the devil who is greater being then god.
 Under our skin , there is a force always looking inwards and providing
 all the necessary things to all cells who are inside and taking care of
 them .
 Now we see these cells on operation or a cut in physical domain , but if
 we close our eyes and look inside we can see a similar univese to ours
 from a position outside it , near our head , our eyes.
 So universe is nothing but a person's body, inwardly controlled by God
 and not that person, however that person is the one who provides food and
 takes work out of the body.
 Interstingly what we see outside is also another universe with all the
 people and we are a small being in this universe while that inner universe
 is so cool we are even bigger than it.
 So what are we? we are at the boundary.
 Why we see both differently is because , like we say that the universe
 has all the planets and solar system and so frightning things and inside
 our body there are the cells the tissues and the brain , heart etc frightening
 things.
 Why do we see them different, This is because we are seeing the outside
 planets and solar systems etc in the spiritual domain , similarly in our
 body we can look in spiritual domain by closing our eyes and looking inwards.
 While the cells and tissues and organs etc are in Physical domain .
 Our universe also has it's physical domain similar to us and we tried to
 visualize the blackhole as an excretory organ.
 There is another domain, the mechanical domain one of the three domains
 which i have seen and it has all the medicine reservoirs in our body and
 we simply refill them or change the medicine already present in our bodies
 in these reservoirs.
 There can be other domains in auditory and speech sections, I myself haven't
 seen them how they work, but i hope there would be atleast 3 domains there
 too in each method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The fantasy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But some people say a blackhole is extremely dangerous, tell some horror
 stories or other intersting stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fruits and vegetables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now there is an intersting story going, and I have seen it with my eyes
 as well.
 10000 years punishment in a blackhole.
 It occours when someone becomes a vegetable or a fruit.
 Now everyday the birth begins , there is very faint light inside the blackhole.
 We can move slightly in the room , the blade starts and we are cut completely
 and then we die.
 Then we wake up and again have a fresh body and it's again cut and then
 we are left to die, it's repeated 84 lakh times in a total time span of
 10000 years.
 This punishment starts when 84 lakh vegetables or fruits are consumed by
 one person.
 Interstingly a chicken on the other hand has relatively much more freedom
 than this case .
 So, a chicken consuming person can be in much better state than this person,
 however traditional hindu religion says not to consume non-veg.
 Possibly the removal of shell of the vegetable , and offering the first
 piece to god etc are possible escape routes from this punishment, while
 Guru Nanak Dev ji says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sayanpan lakh howen , ik na chale naal 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, meaning , that in front of almighty no cleverness works.
 
\series bold
(Don't worry, this doesn't happen ever.
 I'll tell later why.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Howcome?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The universe is only a small part of the world without much significance.
 Now if the complete logic of everything fails, then say a billion universe
 group fails, in that case the error recovery runs.
 I have seen this happeing in my vision (Live) , I know the pain too as
 it happened to me too and also saw the difference in magnitude of pain
 in blackhole, quasar, pulsar etc.
 Blackhole is amongst the easiest as an enemy punishes there.
 In a pulsar , you keep thinking all the time that it's your father who
 is running it.
 All are extremely painfull.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Joke??? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well there are people out there who think that if everything fails it reestablis
hes in no time but in fact it reestablishes in 10000 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What's the best part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best part is that I am a mad person.
 Mostly my sayings are not meant to be believed and what's the use also
 to be getting scared without much reason.
 Thinking about this punishment can give us extreme courage in very dangerous
 situations as any situation can be very very better than this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Other kind of blackhole
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a very funny blackhole created in the name of one person named
 Krishan ( not to be confused with Lord Krishna ).
 In this blackhole there are in infinite number of machine buffalows with
 plastic casings as skin.
 This person krishan has to milk them to survive and he lives in a room
 at the center of that blackhole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Any other kind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One normal blackhole similar to a mother's womb had a person like me at
 it's centre and as that person is big in size, the currents appear small
 , the pressure appears not much etc.
 But then that blackhole starts to end and persons dig into it to live there
 and in the centre that person wakes up as a Black monkey.
 When he woke up the last time there was ola shower in chandigarh, we call
 it mullets or what??? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Other intersting visions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are visions of Durga with 1 tiger and 999 tigresses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another is Durga with 8 billion tigers and tigresses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another is Kali standing on a Damped wave with infinite tigers and tigresses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now these three visions, the scenario is seen at the beginning and starts,
 later what happens is very intersting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one tiger and 999 tigresses, the tiger is able to save durga and takes
 her away.
 He is Man ( the inner heart ) and durga is probably saved in this scenario.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2nd 8 billion tigers and tigresses, all of the tigers and tigresses are
 born out of durga's womb with an explosion and she gets red clothing due
 to the blood which came out along with the birth and due to the explosion
 it spreads on her body.
 In this scenario , durga is later killed by the tigers while some tigers
 try to save her too and fight for righteousness.
 There is an invisible tiger too in this case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Kali one , she looks like priyanka chopra.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there is a 13 member family , where one boy is born at the 7th place
 and he has a sister.
 He kills the sister with her own nail and she later becomes godess and
 creates the world with one tiger .
 Now in that case none of the 13 family members experienced any physical
 pain and the brother who had killed the girl and tiger later gets left
 alone and with one word Aum he sets into meditation and he is one person
 in that world and takes all births of humans and animals etc all alone.
 Now there was a very massive operation which took place when that guy killed
 the girl and the tiger and implanted them in his body.
 It was a perfect operation.
 That guy is dil and there is a floor also where he meditated and that was
 also dil.
 ( It's the heart in hindi ).
 Had that person sinned or not is not known but he is the normal living
 thing we see ourselves and around us.
 Moreover this girl looks a bit clever in the vision and probably knew or
 was pretending that she was not getting harmed in the operation (atleast
 that's what appears from the facial expressions which I saw.).
 Aah I remember, before finally setting into meditiation, he bent his body
 into shapes thinking that the tiger's body shape was different than his
 and he bent his body into 8400000 shapes too.
 So, for example if he bent his body like a mosquito , the mosquito he made
 would be as big as a human.
 The girl's name was Suman Radaa ( similar sounding to modern day Radha
 ) , boy's name was Rahul .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The bible's begining of the world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one of the most popular version's of bible , it is said that the earth
 was already present in the beginning, it had matter and water , these two
 components and probably no air .
 Then the holy spirit ( probably god ) roamed near it in space and with
 one command all the living beings were created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I want to tell what happened in the delta time that command was being
 spoken, we know that before it no living being was there and after it all
 the living beings came to existance.
 Now lets see what happened in that small time.
 Now before that time the matter looks completely calm and dark and water
 was also calm and only spilt when the holy spirit passed by ( sort of primitive
 ocean waves ) .
 The matter was clear in it's mind that it is the strongest and it can't
 be beaten, while the water looks extremely happy and enjoyed even more
 when holy spirit came near and sort of played with it.
 In the place of contact of water and matter, there was some sort of contact
 which was not a matter of conflict between matter and water till the holy
 spirit came to picture.
 Now when the command was spoken, water was the first to get frightened
 and it immediately realised that it's not a single entity and composed
 of smaller particles and they tried to come near each other in a state
 of fear created by the command and disturbances were set in water.
 As the intensity of shrill of the shriek kept on increasing, the disturbances
 further increased and vapour was created.
 Matter was still like a single entity and it was feeling like a pain in
 head ( it's body ) due to the sudden noice and wanted to reply back but
 didn't have a tongue or face for that matter.
 It started withering near the contact , not due to water causing itching
 but because the noice was so painfull to it.
 Later we know that now earth has a hot core and an atmosphere and probably
 formed in the beginning itself .
 All the living things were created after the peak of the delta was reached
 ( similar to birth case ) and slightly after the peak noice .
 All living beings were created, now where did the holy spirit go, it was
 also a human in the plane where lots of other humans were standing and
 he brought out a mic from his pocket and made the first announcement and
 explained the key things to everyone just born.
 Now he was completely mad while everyone else just born was partially mad.
 It's not known what happened to him afterwards but then we know of the
 Adam and eve story and see that he was still present or maybe some of his
 descendents or he himself.
 Then probably Christ was the last in their lineage and now there further
 cults like illuminati claiming that marovengians in france is a group of
 people who have christ's descendents and lineage, and many movies like
 Da Vinci Code showing the legend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now here , from physics point of view , what's important is that matter
 is present, water is separate from matter and then all the charge is concentrat
ed in one supernatural being , the holy spirit .
 Now every human has a soul which is small chage with shiny black colour
 or blue color matter in the interior.
 So we see that Physics mostly is dealing in the Spiritual domain of the
 world and not physical or mechanical domain as much.

Now this is a partially mad man's view , i.e.
 me .
 I can se souls and male souls have mostly black condensed liquid in the
 interior , probably a mixture of matter and water for completeness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However , drug addicts on the other hand think that this cant be the case
 with them.
 They say that their soul is completely white , they say that matter and
 liquid combination can be created as a grass mixture too and can be fed
 inside the charge outer shell of the soul.
 Now interestingly I have myself seen souls which are dense white and are
 very big in size ( 3 to 4 cm dia compared to usual 2mm dia(meter) ) .
 They look like a spherical egg.
 There are other smaller completely white souls too ( with 2.5 cm dia kindaa
 ) , now i don't know whose souls these are in all but some people have
 really peculiar souls.
 It's possible that I am consuming excessive amount of coca cola coke and
 it's visible in my soul.
 In other people's case it can be some other substance they are consuming

Now, we know of Hydrogen.
 What's it like ? does it smell good or bad ? (Well actually hydrogen has
 a punchy smell, you can buy uncle chips and it is packed in Nitrogen getting
 punchy odour due to the chips and the masala) We know it can be used as
 fuel for state of the art combustion cells, and is seen as a modern alternative
 to petroleum.
 We know fusion bombs ( also some are hydrogen bombs ) work on this principle
 , that a neuclear reaction hydrogen atoms combine to form Helium and produce
 lots of energy.
 Hitler's Archeotype which was a baloon like aeroplane having hydrogen caught
 fire and all people inside died (America was an enemy though but also the

Hmmm.
 Hydrogen has importance to physics.
 Then which other elements .
 Let's see .
 Ummm...
 let have a brief look at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Helium, it's the product of a fusion reaction, and an inert gas.
 Used by scuba divers when mixed with oxygen in some particular ratio, it
 has upper hand to nitrogen due to non formation of compounds with blood

Boron, a nuclear product and having nuclear active isotopes too.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carbon, Now this deserves some space.
 Your complete organic chemistry is compounds of carbon.
 Human body has mostly organic compounds as it's living.
 Then we gift diamonds , they are pure carbon.
 What else, we have the carbon contact points in the dc generator motor
 etc.
 We have charcoal , a type of slightly impure carbon used as the bed in
 chemistry salt analysis.
 We have lots of electrical equipments using carbon parts , batteries and
 all, even cells and high voltage ones too have large percentage of carbon
 present.
 Hmmm.
 Is that all, we see that all things which are black are not carbon.
 So we couldn't find as many uses of carbon as it appeared , a blackhole
 is not made of carbon , it can have probably very little percentage of
 it.
 But the human organs are all carbon based organic compounds made .
 We see that Carbon has ample applications in Organic chemistry and biology
 but not as much in Physics but still it can have say few usefull applications
 we can say.
 Mostly coz we talk electricity , we need metals, we talk machines we need
 metals, we talk say civil engineering , we have asphalt there , a carbon
 compound and oil's last residue but otherwise civil engineering has dams
 and large constructions and carbon can have small applications somewhere
 or the other in it but not a massively important material .
 Actually why i am speaking a bit anti is coz since childhood i have been
 told that it's extremely important material and now that i am trying to
 write a paragraph , i find not so many uses to be able to write a good
 paragraph.
 But the atomic number 6 and mass number 12 can say something.
 But then these are human relation talk and not physics talk.
 Let's stay in physics domain only and the judgement is , it's another normal
 element like the rest of the elements, not too useless , not too usefull.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nitrogen, It's odourless .
 Air is odourless and has large percentage of Nitrogen.
 It is used by plants and nitrogenous manures are considered extremely good
 for crops.
 Nitrogen fixing bacteria fix them for plants.
 And I have already said we have nitrogen packaging of food too.
 In a sci-fi movie terminator 2 , the enemy gets nearly killed by the accident
 with a liquid nitrogen tank and few minutes later gets completely killed
 too due to some other reason.

\begin_layout Standard
Oxygen, the massively important material for breathing widely portrayed
 in sci-fi that people in mars and the rebillion there are getting lesser
 of it.
 Mostly kept and extracted for artificial respiration systems.
 Oxides are a trouble as they are to be broken back to get the pure element
 and the pure element sometimes comes in contact with air and forms oxide
 again.
 No special use as far as physics is concerned.
 If we spell it as Oak-season then it refers to the dirtiest enemy in the
 Mythology movies.
 And they keep on attacking in their season.
 Now clean air is devtas according to some people( according to me too as
 i have seen them ) and bhagwan is foul air ( clean air which has gathered
 some foul and is smelling bad now ) , now what is oxygen it remains to
 be questioned as it's a part of both clean and foul air .
 The hindu devta refers to faint light while it is different to the portrayal
 of Elves in English movies and even more different in chinese movies except
 that elves and devtas fought in favour of humans and won the war.
 Now it's interesting that animals are bhagwan and interstingly they have
 been shown as the asuras in hindu mythology while different portrayals
 of animals have appeared in Western movies.
 According to most IITians the indian eunuchs are devtas and animals are
 bhagwan also shown as asuras in popular books.
 Now hinduism is extremely anti to both eunuchs and animals while it always
 keeps on worshiping idols of devtas and bhagwans.
 In the contrary Islamists are somewhat friendly to eunuchs but then they
 are completely anti to animals and hate them in all respect.
 In islam, most islamist names are similar sounding to eunuch words in hindi
 or probably hindi has been designed in this way.
 One intersting example is when i first listened to nusrat fateh ali khan,
 one guy vikas bhatt in my class told the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

khusra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that it means eunuch.
 It seems that in special hindi every islamic name is attached to this kind
 of words.
 Interstingly very few of the fewest names in Islam are like Khurram meaning
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

with a Khur
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or a horse / donkey / deer like animal.
 Probably in ahmediya community it seems.
 Then there was the lijjat papad hindi ad showing karram kurram as the tag

 There are actors like Shahrukh Khan who were offered role of the lead eunuch
 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 movie which he rejected and later started speaking extremely anti to eunuchs.
 Then in Sikhism the names are like dead matter but singh word is attached,
 so they say we are animal but no ordinary animal but only the tiger or
 the loin.
 So different social values we see.
 So we were discussing oxygen , it's a part of both eunuchs ( Pure air )
 and animals ( foul air ) and humans too consume it.

 Sodna means a very bad term in punjabi sexual terminology.
 It's intersting that the english terminology has chosen the name sodium

 As far as physics is concerned , in present times we don't see much use

If there exists a composite function y =

 Then

 can be expressed in a more convenient form i.e

 Ofcourse, the composite function can be further branched.
 In that case, the chain would become longer.

Let

A graph is an accurate pictorial representation of data.
 The accuracy of data in physics requires that graphs be made on good quality
 graph paper.
 Nearly all graphs in physics are smooth line graphs; broken line (connect
 the dots) graphs and bar graphs are seldom appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style and format of a graph will depend upon its intended purpose.
 Three types are common in physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 PICTORIAL GRAPHS.
 These are the kind found in mathematics and physics textbooks.
 Their purpose is to simply and clearly illustrate a mathematical relation.
 No attempt is made to show data points or errors on such a graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 DISPLAY GRAPHS.
 These present the data from an experiment.
 They are found in laboratory reports, research journals, and sometimes
 in textbooks.
 They show the data points as well as a smooth line representing the mathematica
l relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 COMPUTATIONAL GRAPHS.
 These are drawn for the purpose of extracting a numerical result from the
 data.
 An example is the calculation of the slope of a straight line graph, or
 its intercepts.

A French curve is a template usually made from metal, wood or plastic composed
 of many different curves.
 It is used in manual drafting to draw smooth curves of varying radii.
 The shapes are segments of the Euler spiral or clothoid curve.
 The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a pencil, knife or other
 implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems use vector-based graphics to
 achieve a precise radius, so no template is required.
 Digital computers can also be used to generate a set of coordinates that
 accurately describe an arbitrary curve, and the points can be connected
 with line segments to approximate the curve with a high degree of accuracy.
 Some computer-graphics systems make use of Bézier curves, which allow a
 curve to be bent in real time on a display screen to follow a set of coordinate
s, much in the way a French curve would be placed on a set of three or four
 points on paper.

PHYSICAL SLOPE AND GEOMETRIC SLOPE

Slope.
 When textbooks refer to the "slope" of a plotted graph line we mean the
 "physical slope"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
physical slope = 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{\text{Δ}y}{\text{Δ}x}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Δy and Δx are expressed in the physical units of the x and y axes.
 This slope has physical significance in describing the physical data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Geometric slope.
 A line which makes a 45° angle with an axis will not necessarily have a
 physical slope of size 1.
 Some authors introduce the term "geometric slope" to describe the tilt
 of the line on the page.
 This is a ratio of lengths of the legs of the triangle, without reference
 to the units plotted on the axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is seldom (probably never) any need to calculate the geometric slope
 of a line on a graph.
 The idea is only useful when describing the appearance of the graph on
 the page.
 One rule of graph construction states that the graph should occupy most
 of the page.
 For square graph paper this suggests a geometric slope of 45°.
 See Fig for examples of good and bad choices of geometric slope.

Graphical Representation of Uncertainties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display graphs and computational graphs should clearly show the size of
 the experimental uncertainties (errors) in each plotted point.
 There are several conventional ways to do this, the commonest being the
 use of error bars illustrated below:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted point is represented as a dot, and the range of uncertainty
 is shown by the extent of the bars on either side.
 The types shown in (a) are suitable where the error is entirely in one
 variable, or where the errors in both variables have been lumped together.
 The types shown in (b) are preferred where it is necessary to show the
 error in each variable explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the uncertainties have a symmetric distribution about the mean, the
 error bars extend equally on either side of the points.
 If the data distributions are not symmetric, the plotted points will not
 be centrally located in the range of uncertainty and the error bars might
 look like those in Figure.
 part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars may not be necessary when the data points are so numerous that
 their scatter is clearly shows the uncertainty.
 In these cases error bars would clutter the graph making it difficult to
 interpret.
 Another situation where error bars are inappropriate is when the scale
 of the graph is such that the bars would be very small.
 In this case, it may be possible to indicate the uncertainty by the size
 of the circle or rectangle surrounding each point.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve drawn through plotted data need not pass exactly through every
 data point.
 But usually the curve should pass within the uncertainty range of each
 point, that is, within the error bars, if the bars represent limits of
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One principle of curve fitting is also a fundamental rule of science itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the simplest relation consistent with the data.
 We are not justified in assuming a more complex relation than can be demonstrat
ed by the data.
 If a curve were drawn with detail smaller than the data uncertainty, that
 detail would be only a guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rule of simplicity may also be expressed mathematically.
 The mathematical relations encountered in physics may often be represented
 by power series such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $y=A+Bx+Cx^{2}+Dx^{3}+Ex^{4}+...$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where A, B, C, ...
 are constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For very "wiggly" curves, many terms of this equation, including high powers
 of x, might be required to express the equation of the relation.
 The simplest relations are those which contain the smallest powers of x.
 The simplest relations of all are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = a or y = a + bx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which describe straight lines.
 Many relations in physics are, fortunately, of this form.
 Others only include the 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 term, describing a parabolic curve.
 Note that double valued curves, sometimes encountered in physics, cannot
 be represented by Equation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sizable amounts of data are taken, standard mathematical methods are
 available which generate the equation of the simplest curve which statistically
 "best fits" the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student may wonder how one can be certain that the curve fitted to the
 data is the "correct" curve.
 The answer is that relations are never known with certainty.
 The uncertainty of available data always limits the certainty of the results.
 Someday someone may obtain more accurate data and be able to show that
 the old relations are slightly incorrect, and provide us with better ones.
 As data improves, so does our understanding of relations—this is the way
 of scientific progress.
 But we never should claim to know a relation better than the data allows.

So far this discussion has been strictly mathematical.
 Now let's consider a fairly realistic physical example.
 Figure.
 shows the curve from measurements of the velocity of a moving body as a
 function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we use letters v for velocity and t for time, we'd expect this curve
 to be described by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the constant a (acceleration) is the slope of the line, while v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 plays the role of b in Equation.
 These two constants are physically significant, and we wish to find their
 values from the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose two points on the line at t = 4.25 and 8.75, with corresponding
 values of velocity: 42 cm/s and 98 cm/s.
 Mark these points on Figure.
 , to confirm these values.
 The slope of the line is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $a=\dfrac{(98cm/s-42cm/s)}{8.75s-4.25s}=\dfrac{56}{4.5}\;cm/s^{2}=56/4.5\;cm/s^{2}=12.44cm/s^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When calculating this ratio do not use ruler-measured lengths.
 The lengths are expressed in the units marked on the graph axes.
 The calculated slope is therefore independent of the particular choice
 of units, of the way you choose to label the graph scale divisions, and
 is also independent of the size of the graph paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
INTERCEPTS: The values of the intercepts are often physically significant.
 They can be simply read from the graph—if the 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$

 axes happen to be within the graph's boundaries.
 In the equation y = mx + b, the y intercept is b.

The v intercept of Figure.
 is the value of v when t = 0.
 It has the same units and dimensions as y.
 If, as in this case, the v intercept does not lie within the area of the
 graph, it may be calculated using the slope and one value taken from a
 point on the fitted line.
 Take the point v = 98 cm/s when t = 8.75 sec.

STRAIGHTENING A CURVE.
 When it is possible to convert an experimental relation to a straight line
 graph it is usually useful to do so.
 Look for such opportunities.
 For example, when studying gases at constant temperature we find that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PV = C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where P is pressure, V is the gas volume and C is constant.
 The graph of P vs.
 V is a branch of an hyperbola.
 But if we graph P vs.
 1/V, or V vs.
 1/P, the data would fall on a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason for doing this is that it is easier to fit the experimental data
 with a ruler-drawn straight line, than to draw the best hyperbola on a
 PV graph.
 Another advantage is that the P vs.
 1/V graph has a slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $C=\dfrac{\triangle P}{\triangle\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)}$
\end_inset

Therefore the constant C is easily determined from the straight line.
 This constant was not evident, nor was it easy to determine from the PV
 graph!

\begin_layout Standard
Working with graphs – interpreting, creating, and employing – is an essential
 skill in the sciences, and especially in physics where relationships need
 to be derived.
 As an introductory physics student you should be familiar with the typical
 forms of graphs that appear in physics.
 Below are a number of typical physical relationships exhibited graphically
 using standard X-Y coordinates (e.g., no logarithmic, power, trigonometric,
 or inverse plots, etc.).
 Study the forms of the graphs carefully, and be prepared to use the program
 Graphical Analysis to formulate relationships between variables by using
 appropriate curve-fitting strategies.
 Note that all non-linear forms of graphs can be made to appear linear by
 “linearizing” the data.
 Linearization consists of such things as plotting X versus Y
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 or X versus 1/Y or Y versus log (X), etc.
 Note: While a 5th order polynomial might give you a better fit to the data,
 it might not represent the simplest model.

Change in Momentum or the "Impulse"

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this form, the change in momentum is calculated over a “discrete” time
 step.
 That is, the calculation is done over a known or determined time interval.
 If the force is non-constant (i.e., depends on location or velocity), this
 calculation is not exact.
 In fact, in this case, the net force is the average net force over the
 time interval.
 So that a better definition is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net,avg}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition works well for case where you might use iterative procedures
 to determine the change in momentum over small time intervals.
 If on the other hand, you can analytically integrate the force (e.g., it
 is or can be put into a form which is time dependent), then you can use
 the derivative form of the Momentum Principle,

Force vs Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations, it is easier to empirically measure force versus time
 graphs because the situations lend themselves more easily to these empirical
 measurements rather than what might be more complex physical theories.
 This is true in different engineering contexts (e.g., impact design and the
 flow of fluids).
 In these cases, you are interested in determining the change in momentum
 (and thus the velocity) of the system in question1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a force vs time graph where the “area under the curve” has been
 highlighted.
 In this example, we are only looking at the component of the net force
 in the xx-direction.
 Such graphs can be produced for each component of the net force, but let's
 say that for this system, there was a non-zero component of the net force
 only in the x-direction.

For the above figure, the momentum change over the complete time interval
 can be determined in a straightforward way due to the simple geometric
 shapes produced.
 Area above the zero line are positive momentum changes, and area below
 are negative.
 By adding up the “area under the curve” in this way, we obtain a momentum
 change of 7 Ns.

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below shows the force vs time graph for another system.
 In this case, the graph has a smooth form, which doesn't appear to be analytic.
 The “area under the curve” for this graph could be analyzed computationally,

 be determined.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Static frictional forces from the interlocking of the irregularities of
 two surfaces will increase to prevent any relative motion up until some
 limit where motion occurs.
 It is that threshold of motion which is characterized by the coefficient
 of static friction.
 The coefficient of static friction is typically larger than the coefficient
 of kinetic friction.

\begin_layout Standard
In making a distinction between static and kinetic coefficients of friction,
 we are dealing with an aspect of "real world" common experience with a
 phenomenon which cannot be simply characterized.
 The difference between static and kinetic coefficients obtained in simple
 experiments like wooden blocks sliding on wooden inclines roughly follows
 the model depicted in the friction plot from which the illustration above
 is taken.
 This difference may arise from irregularities, surface contaminants, etc.
 which defy precise description.
 When such experiments are carried out with smooth metal blocks which are
 carefully cleaned, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients
 tends to disappear.
 When coefficients of friction are quoted for specific surface combinations
 are quoted, it is the kinetic coefficient which is generally quoted since
 it is the more reliable number.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Kinetic Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When two surfaces are moving with respect to one another, the frictional
 resistance is almost constant over a wide range of low speeds, and in the
 standard model of friction the frictional force is described by the relationshi
p below.
 The coefficient is typically less than the coefficient of static friction,
 reflecting the common experience that it is easier to keep something in
 motion across a horizontal surface than to start it in motion from rest.

The above plot, though representing a simplistic view of friction, agrees
 fairly well with the results of simple experiments with wooden blocks on
 wooden inclines.
 The experimental procedure described below equates the vector component
 of the weight down the incline to the coefficient of friction times the
 normal force produced by the weight on the incline.

Having taken a large number of students through this experiment, I can report
 that the coefficient of static friction obtained is almost always greater
 than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
 Typical results for the woods I have used are 0.4 for the static coefficient
 and 0.3 for the kinetic coefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When carefully standardized surfaces are used to measure the friction coefficien
ts, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients tends to disappear,
 indicating that the difference may have to do with irregular surfaces,
 impurities, or other factors which can be frustratingly non-reproducible.
 To quote a view counter to the above model of friction: "Many people believe
 that the friction to be overcome to get something started (static friction)
 exceeds the force required to keep it sliding (sliding friction), but with
 dry metals it is very hard to show any difference.
 The opinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or
 lubricant are present, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs
 or other flexible supports so that they appear to bind." R.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rolling Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rolling wheel requires a certain amount of friction so that the point
 of contact of the wheel with the surface will not slip.
 The amount of traction which can be obtained for an auto tire is determined
 by the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road.
 If the wheel is locked and sliding, the force of friction is determined
 by the coefficient of kinetic friction and is usually significantly less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that a wheel is rolling without slipping, the surface friction
 does no work against the motion of the wheel and no energy is lost at that
 point.
 However, there is some loss of energy and some deceleration from friction
 for any real wheel, and this is sometimes referred to as rolling friction.
 It is partly friction at the axle and can be partly due to flexing of the
 wheel which will dissipate some energy.
 Figures of 0.02 to 0.06 have been reported as effective coefficients of rolling
 friction for automobile tires, compared to about 0.8 for the maximum static
 friction coefficient between the tire and the road.

 : (Theory : So far we've implied some things about what is constant and
 what can change in the impulse formula F Δt = m Δv.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at situations where we expect the mass of the object will stay constant.
 • The velocity will change, and that's why we put a delta in front of it.
 • Time is changing (sort of) as we measure it over a period of time.
 • Force must be a constant.
 We assume that the force being exerted on the object was always the same,
 causing a constant acceleration.
 If we are looking at a simple impulse question (where the force is constant),
 we can figure out exactly what we can interpret from a graph.
 • Later this may help us to figure out a more complicated question, like
 if the force changes.
 The following graph is an example of one of those simple situations where
 the force remains constant during the entire time.
 • If we look at what the slope might represent, we get...

\begin_layout Standard
slope = rise / run 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
slope = F / 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since nothing in the impulse formula can be rearranged to give us force
 over time, the slope doesn't mean anything to us in this situation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we really wanted to, we could have simply use Δp = FΔt to figure out
 the impulse.
 We could do this in this situation because the force is constant.
 • If we need to do a question where the force is not constant, we can still
 use the area under the line to get the impulse, even though the formula
 Δp = FΔt can not be used.

 I want to calculate the impulse that is acting on the car during the first

 N over this time, determine the impulse.

 ◦ Instead, we just look at the triangle drawn in red.
 For the little bit extra it has near the beginning, it misses a bit later

\begin_layout Standard
EXPLORATION – An impulsive bike ride Suki is riding her bicycle, in a straight
 line, along a flat road.
 Suki and her bike have a combined mass of 50 kg.
 At t = 0, Suki is traveling at 8.0 m/s.
 Suki coasts for 10 seconds, but when she realizes she is slowing down,
 she pedals for the next 20 seconds.
 Suki pedals so that the static friction force exerted on the bike by the
 road increases linearly with time from 0 to 40 N, in the direction Suki
 is traveling, over that 20-second period.
 Assume there is constant 10 N resistive force, from air resistance and
 other factors, acting on her and the bicycle the entire time.
 Step 1 - Sketch a diagram of the situation.
 The diagram is shown in Figure 6.2, along with the free-body diagram that
 applies for the first 10 s and the free-body diagram that applies for the
 20second period while Suki is pedaling.

\end_inset

 gradually increases because of the way Suki pedals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 - Sketch a graph of the net force acting on Suki and her bicycle
 as a function of time.
 Take the positive direction to be the direction Suki is traveling.
 In the vertical direction, the normal force exactly balances the force
 of gravity, so we can focus on the horizontal forces.
 For the first 10 seconds, we have only the 10 N resistive force, which
 acts to oppose the motion and is thus in the negative direction.
 For the next 20 seconds, we have to account for the friction force that
 acts in the direction of motion and the resistive force.
 We can account for their combined effect by drawing a straight line that
 goes from –10 N at t = 10 s, to +30 N (40 N – 10N) at t = 30 s.
 The result is shown in Figure 6.3.

\begin_layout Standard
Step 3 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 10 s? Let’s apply Equation 6.3, which
 we can write as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{\rightarrow}{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=\text{∆}(m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})=m\text{∆}\overrightarrow{v}=m(\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}-\overrightarrow{v_{i}})$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the velocity at t = 10 s gives: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}=\overrightarrow{v_{i}}+\dfrac{\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t}{m}=+8.0m/s+\dfrac{(-10N)(10s)}{50kg}=+8.0m/s-2.0m/s=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, Suki’s speed at t = 10 s is 6.0 m/s.
 We can also obtain this result from the forceversus-time graph, by recognizing
 that the impulse, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t$
\end_inset

 , represents the area under this graph over some time interval ∆t .
 Let’s find the area under the graph, over the first 10 seconds, shown highlight
ed in green in Figure 6.4.
 The area is negative, because the net force is negative over that time
 interval.
 The area under the graph is the impulse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=-10N\times10s=-100Ns=-100kg\;m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6.4: The green rectangle represents the area under the graph for the
 first 10 s.
 The area is negative, because the force is negative.
 From Equation 6.3, we know the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $m\overrightarrow{v_{i}}=50kg\times8.0m/s=+400kg\;m/s$
\end_inset

 .
 Her momentum at t = 10 s is therefore + 400kg m/s - 100kg m/s = + 300kg
 m/s .
 Dividing this by the mass to find the velocity at t = 10 s confirms what
 we found above: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v}_{10s}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{10s}}}{m}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{i}}+\triangle\overrightarrow{p}}{m}=\dfrac{+400kgm/s-100kgm/s}{50kg}=\dfrac{+300kgm/s}{50kg}=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 4 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 30 s? Let’s use the area under the
 force-versus-time graph, between t = 10 s and t = 30 s, to find Suki’s
 change in momentum over that 20-second period.
 This area is highlighted in Figure 6.5, split into a negative area for the
 time between t = 10 s and t = 15 s, and a positive area between t = 15
 s and t = 30 s.
 These regions are triangles, so we can use the equation for the area of
 a triangle, 0.5 × base × height .
 The area under the curve, between 10 s and 15 s, is 0.5 × (5.0s) ×( - 10
 N) = - 25kg m/s .
 The area between 15 s and 30 s is 0.5 × (15s) × (30 N) = + 225kg m/s .
 The total area (total change in momentum) is +200 kg m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that another approach is to multiply the average net force acting on
 Suki and the bicycle (+10 N) over this interval, by the time interval (20
 s), for a +200 kg m/s change in momentum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
In step 3, we determined that Suki’s momentum at t = 10 s is +300 kg m/s.
 With the additional 200 kg m/s, the net momentum at t = 10 s is +500 kg
 m/s.
 Dividing by the 50 kg mass gives a velocity at t = 30 s of +10 m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key idea for the graphical interpretation of impulse: The area under the
 net force versus time graph for a particular time interval is equal to
 the change in momentum during that time interval.

Position vs time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph of position verse time is a sine wave with a possible phase shift.
 The phase shift is how much the ahead or behind the position is on the
 sine wave.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider this graph, if the "clock" is started at 0.05 (where the mass is
 at it's maximum stretch) seconds then there would be a phase shift of 90
 degrees (or we could replace the sine function for a cosine).
 If the "clock" is started at 0.1 seconds (where mass moves down instead
 of up; left instead of right) then the phase shift would be 180 degrees
 (a negative sine function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Velocity vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the position verses time graph, at any point were the mass has
 reached the amplitude (maximum distance from from the equilibrium point)
 the speed of the mass at these point is zero.
 When the position is at zero then the speed is at a maximum (if you don't
 believe it, consider conservation of energy).
 This "shifts" the position graph by 90 degrees "creating" a cosine graph
 for velocity.
 The other way of thinking about is velocity is the change in position with
 respect to time, the change in a sine wave with respect to time is a cosine
 graph.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Acceleration vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acceleration verse time graph is the easiest of the graphs to make.
 The simple harmonic motion is based on a relationship between position
 and acceleration; x = - Ka.
 So the graph of position and acceleration should look alike, except for
 the negative sign.
 In fact position and acceleration are the same shape just mirror copies
 of each other.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Peak Height
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the shapes of each graph is simular, that each
 graph has the same frequency, period and wavelength, but they don't have
 the same amplitude, for common simple harmonic motion, the height the peak
 of the function (not to confused with the amplitude, amplitude refers to
 the height of the position graph alone, i'm talking about the height of
 the position, velocity and acceleration graphs) tend to get smaller and
 smaller starting with the position graph being the tallest and the acceleration
 being the shortest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Graphing position, velocity, and acceleration with respect to each other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphing position to the other functions can be complicated and when tested
 on it, most student are unable to give the right answer.
 First consider this, for simple harmonic motion position and acceleration
 are proportional.
 x = -k a this is a linear relationship so the graph is a line, the slope
 is negative so the line is heading down.

Position and acceleration verses velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position and acceleration verse velocity graph look entirely different.
 First off the straight line test fails when plotting position vs velocity
 or acceleration verse velocity.
 Take the point were x and a are zero, there are two possible answers for
 the point (the speed maybe at maximum) the object could be moving down
 or up at the point.
 That means the velocity can be a positive maximum or a negative maximum,
 two separate values.
 Looking a the points were the velocity is equal to zero, there are two
 possible answers, either at the top or at the bottom.
 If you continue to plot data points graph that is developed is a ellisipe

Paragraph 1: When a particle of mass m moves on the x-axis in a potential

 it performs simple harmonic motion.
 The corresponding time period is proportional to

 However, the motion of a particle can be periodic even when its potential
 energy increases on both sides of x=0 in a way different from

In Figure let the charge on a capacitor of capacitance C at any instant
 be q, and let V be the potential difference across it at that instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current (I) in the discharge at that instant is therefore: I = - dq/dt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But V = IR and q = CV so dq/dt = d(CV)/dt = C dV/dt Therefore we have V

You should realise that the term RC governs the rate at which the charge

When t = RC, V = Vo/e = 0.37 Vo and the product RC is known as the time constant

\begin_layout Part
Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mechanics is basically introduction to Mechanical Engineering , that's true
 but for intermediate level , we mostly present the ideal case only and
 not the practical cases.
 So , for example we can assume that a block moving with an acceleration
 can keep on moving like that for as long time as we want, another particle
 moving with constant velocity moving like that , now this thing might not
 look very cool to a proper mechanical engineer say from Delhi College of
 engineering like my brother Manish Kalia who goes on further to steer in
 college designed racing cars and airplane designs.
 However to an IITian mechanical engineer like the Fiitjee head , he goes
 on further to make new questions and theory working on the ideal case .
 So, there is a difference, if one is intersted in designing real mechanics
 in India, he should choose DCE and if one wants to work on ideal theory
 one should choose ME in IIT.
 What are the other options? You can very well join MIT if you can clear
 the entrance procedure or some other good college.
 Now as far as india is concerned DCE is the best in Mechanical and IIT
 is the in general best college.
 MIT on the other hand is the world's best college (and the oldest as well).
 Now manish is into teaching Mathematics for indian college entrance and
 one of his students Keshav went to MIT and other girl Ravi to UC and there
 are plenty people in other world over good universities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Mechanics which we would study won't have car design constraints, it
 won't have the windscreen mechanisms it won't have too many examples of
 tyre motion or other practical situation things.
 We would be dealing with problems mostly in the ideal case which would
 appear impractical to someone working on real cases since childhood.
 Now for the MIT case, it is a research university i would say and people
 there are really smart and immediately recognized worldover but they are
 also real humans and have real life problems too.
 UC i don't know, those people are also doing good i think.
 Then there is the Stanford where i studied in previous birth , it appears
 very good to me .
